  o Standardized Date formats for accurate analysis.

This meticulous cleaning and processing stage ensured the dataset was accurate, consistent, and primed for insightful analysis.

# Data Analysis and Insights

The data analysis phase focused on leveraging Power BI to uncover meaningful insights from supermarket sales data. By examining key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales revenue, product profitability, and customer behavior, the analysis provided a clear understanding of business performance across multiple dimensions.

### 1 What is the Total amount of Revenue generated?

The primary reason for calculating total revenue is because it provides a clear picture of a business's overall financial performance and It helps in answering critical business questions such as:

1. Measuring Business Performance:

Shows how well the business is doing financially over a period.

Helps compare performance across branches, days, or time periods.

2. Identifying Peak Periods:

Reveals which days, weeks, or months generate the highest revenue.

Helps with resource allocation, such as staffing during peak days.

3. Evaluating Product/Service Demand:

Highlights which product lines or services contribute most to revenue.

Guides inventory planning to avoid stockouts or overstocking.

 4. Strategic Decision-Making:

Informs decisions on marketing campaigns, pricing strategies, and promotions.

Helps management focus on high-revenue-generating areas.

5. Profitability Analysis:

Serves as the foundation for calculating other metrics like Gross Profit, Profit Margins, and Return on Investment (ROI).

Indicates whether operational costs are justified by the revenue.

it was calculated through summation of the record in the revenue column across all the 3-branch/city

```Total Revenue = sum(SalesTable[Revenue])```

### 2. what is the total revenue generated by each branch?
   
The total revenue generated from each branch/city in this supermarket dataset is crucial because it provides key business insights, such as:

1. Performance Analysis

Identify Top-Performing Branches: 
 
  - Which branch generates the most revenue?  
  
  - Helps focus investments on high-performing locations.  
  
  Spot Underperforming Branches: 
 
  - Recognize branches struggling to meet revenue targets.  
  
  - Inform decisions on resource allocation or strategy adjustments.  

 2. Resource Allocation

    Staffing Decisions:
 
  - Higher revenue may indicate higher foot traffic, requiring more staff.  
 
  - Helps in planning shifts and labor costs.  

Inventory Management:

  - High-revenue branches need faster stock replenishment.  
 
  - Prevents stockouts or overstocking.  

3. Marketing Strategy

Targeted Promotions:
  
  - Branches with lower revenue might benefit from more promotions or discounts.  
  
  - High-revenue branches could try premium pricing or loyalty programs.  


4. Business Growth and Expansion**  

Location Insights:
  
  - Data shows which Branch/city are more profitable.  
  
  - Helps in deciding where to open new stores.  


5. Profitability Analysis
     
- Revenue alone doesn’t equal profit, but it is a starting point.  

- Combine it with **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** to measure **Gross Profit**.  

- High revenue with low profit indicates high expenses.

Percentage Total revenue generated by each branch/city

![](https://github.com/Emmanuelakanmu/MACRONAC-SALES-SUPERMAKET-DASHBOARD/blob/main/percentage%20of%20total%20revenue%20generated%20by%20each%20branch%20location.jpg)

- *Naypyitaw* generates the highest revenue ($110,570**, 34.24%).  
- *Mandalay* and *Yangon* are almost equal, each around *$106,200* (32.88%).  
- This suggests that *Naypyitaw may have a larger or more high-spending customer base*.  

3 what is the average revenue of each branch/city?

The **average revenue generated by each branch/city** is essential because it provides deeper insights into the business beyond just total revenue. It helps in evaluating **consistency, efficiency, and performance**. Here's why it matters:


1. Performance Benchmarking  
- **Total Revenue vs. Average Revenue:**  
  - A branch with high total revenue might seem successful, but its **average revenue per transaction** or **per day** could reveal inefficiencies.  
  - **Higher average revenue** suggests better sales efficiency.  
- **Identify Outliers:**  
  - Spot branches with **exceptionally low or high** average revenue.  
  - Helps pinpoint issues like poor sales tactics or outstanding performance.  


2. Business Efficiency Analysis 
- **Evaluate Sales Efficiency:**  
  - High total revenue could result from **volume**, but low average revenue indicates **lower spending per customer**.  
  - Helps improve pricing strategies or cross-selling tactics.  
- **Resource Optimization:**  
  - Branches with **higher average revenue** might handle more revenue with **fewer resources**, suggesting better efficiency.

3. Strategic Pricing and Promotions 
- **Understand Buying Behavior:**  
  - Average revenue highlights **customer spending habits**.  
  - Branches with lower averages may need targeted promotions to increase basket size.  
- **Promotional Effectiveness:**  
  - Helps assess the impact of discounts, loyalty programs, or seasonal sales on customer spending.  

4. Forecasting and Financial Planning  
- **Budget Allocation:**  
  - Consistent average revenue helps with **revenue projections**.  
  - Improves the accuracy of **financial forecasts** for each branch or city.  
- **Investment Decisions:**  
  - Helps decide which branches deserve more resources, expansions, or marketing budgets.  

5. Comparing Similar-Sized Branches 
- **Fair Comparison:**  
  - Total revenue might be misleading if one branch serves a larger population.  
  - Average revenue normalizes performance, offering a fair comparison.

 6. **Address Profit Fluctuations to Ensure Stability**  

- Monthly profit analysis showed a decline in **February** across branches, which recovered in **March**.  

- Investigate reasons for the drop, such as **seasonality** or **customer behavior patterns**, and create contingency plans like **seasonal promotions** or **special events** during low-profit months.  


 7. **Leverage Peak Times for Targeted Promotions**  

- Sales by hour (though previously inconsistent in extraction) likely highlight peak shopping hours.  

- Run time-specific promotions such as **“Happy Hour Discounts”** during off-peak periods to maintain foot traffic and sales throughout the day.  


 8. **Encourage Digital Payment Adoption for Faster Transactions**  

- With the increasing popularity of **e-wallets** (33.44%), offer incentives such as **cashback** or **instant discounts** to encourage its use.  

- Faster transactions improve customer satisfaction and reduce wait times during peak hours.  


 9. **Balance Cost and Revenue Across Branches**  

- The total cost of goods sold analysis showed **Naypyitaw** with slightly higher costs compared to other branches.  

- Regularly review and **negotiate with suppliers** for better pricing, or optimize **inventory management** to reduce overstocking and wastage.  


10. **Implement Data-Driven Decision Making for Continuous Improvement**  

- Utilize business intelligence tools like **Power BI** to continuously monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **profit margins**, **customer satisfaction**, and **payment preferences**.  

- Schedule **monthly performance reviews** and adapt strategies based on data trends.  


## Conclusion
  

Based on the detailed analysis of sales, profit, customer satisfaction, payment methods, and branch performance, it is evident that the business demonstrates steady growth with notable strengths in **branch profitability** and **diverse payment adoption**. However, certain fluctuations in **monthly profits**, **day-wise sales**, and **product satisfaction** indicate areas requiring targeted improvement.

Key takeaways include:  

- **Monday** consistently outperforms other days in sales, suggesting an opportunity to replicate this success on slower days like **Friday**.  

**Naypyitaw** stands out as the highest revenue-generating branch, though better cost management could improve net profits.  

- The near-equal distribution of payment methods reflects a well-balanced customer preference, yet strategic incentives can encourage further adoption of underutilized modes.  

- **Fashion accessories** and **electronics** received the highest customer satisfaction, while other categories could benefit from enhanced quality or promotional offers.  

To sustain long-term growth, the business must leverage its strengths while addressing identified gaps through **cost optimization**, **promotional campaigns**, and 
**customer engagement initiatives**. Continuous monitoring and **data-driven decision-making** will be crucial in maintaining a competitive edge.
