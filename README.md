2. Identifying Peak Periods:

Reveals which days, weeks, or months generate the highest revenue.

Helps with resource allocation, such as staffing during peak days.

3. Evaluating Product/Service Demand:

Highlights which product lines or services contribute most to revenue.

Guides inventory planning to avoid stockouts or overstocking.

✅ 4. Strategic Decision-Making:

Informs decisions on marketing campaigns, pricing strategies, and promotions.

Helps management focus on high-revenue-generating areas.

✅ 5. Profitability Analysis:

Serves as the foundation for calculating other metrics like Gross Profit, Profit Margins, and Return on Investment (ROI).

Indicates whether operational costs are justified by the revenue.

it was calculated through summation of the record in the revenue column across all the 3-branch/city

```Total Revenue = sum(SalesTable[Revenue])```
